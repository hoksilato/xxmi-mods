## Version

### 1.4 - [Link](https://gamebanana.com/tools/18446)

Only a few characters have been affected by this patch, with some changes being more notable than others.

#### LightMap / FaceShadow Issue

Several characters in the game share this texture, such as Yangyan, Chixia, and others. In this patch, not only the hash but the texture itself was changed. If a single mod uses the old texture, it will conflict with all others since the hash is shared.

The script searches for the old texture and replaces it. If the issue is still not resolved, search through the mods until you find the culprit.

**IMPORTANT**

If your mod is broken and the First line after `[Constants]` is something like this:

```
global $required_wwmi_version = 0.61
```

If the version is bellow `0.70` the mod can't be fixed, you need to press <kbd>ALT + F12</kbd> to enable compatibility mode and pray, it will glitch.
You can ping me on AGMG and I can give a proper look if is the case.

**REMEMBER**

I don't have a crystal ball to know why "n" mod wasn't just fixed with just name, the minimum expected is that they send the link to the mod (gamebanana only).

Changli is a very complex case; some mods in component mode and merged aswell can be fixed, but there are some Changli mods that are impossible to fix with scripts alone.

#### Broken Characters

- Changli
- Rover (Female)
- Jianxin

The trigger to remap the `Changli` fingers is the hash: `060f5303` (Shapekeys Hash). If, for some reason, your Changli mod is already  have this hash updated, it will not trigger. Also, as Iâ€™ve mentioned many times, not all Changli mods can be fixed without re-exporting them. Everything depends on how the modder created the assets.

### 1.2 - [Link](https://gamebanana.com/tools/17752)

> Author: Gustav0

> Does not work for mods made using `Per-Component`

Only a few characters have been affected by this patch, with some changes being more notable than others.

#### Minor Changes (Hash Change)

The following characters have only undergone changes to their hashes:

- Calcharo
- Rover (Female and Male)
- Baizhi
- Yinlin
- Jiyan

#### Major Changes (Remap)

##### Verina

Has undergone a remap in her vertex groups, making this fix more complex.

- If you have run a previous fix on Verina, download the mod again and run it fresh, as it will cause conflict and not perform the remap.

#### Complex Changes

##### Changli

Has undergone the most significant changes in this patch, with her cape being re-weighted and new vertices added. Due to the large number of vertex groups, her fix was more challenging.
